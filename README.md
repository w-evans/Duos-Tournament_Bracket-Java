FinalProject
============
CSIS10a - Java Programming Final Project


Blind Draw Tournament Bracket Application


Instructions:

1) Upon compile/run, Program automatically adds 16 players, shuffles them, and assigns teams of 2 and prepares first round matchups

2) Negotiate each invidiual matchup (blue blocks) by clicking grey ".." button, winner will progress to next round, loser will move brackets

3) Progress each matchup in whatever order you like until final round is populated with two teams, and an alert window will appear showing the winner when that matchup is completed


Additional Notes:

-Player add/delete functionality is not complete (future project)

-Upper right list will display the teams (will display added players in future)



Key things learned:

I needed a lot less code and classes than I expected. I should of worked on the GUI first, it was a pain but I learned a lot about swing components and I feel like I will make a much more polished and functional GUI on the next project I work on. I also learned how to use
Github a bunch, and look forward to learning the more intricate details about the small important stuff I can do to manage a project.
