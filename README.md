CSIS 10a 
Java Programming Final Project


1) Web App Blind Draw Tournament Bracket (Already Started)

App will take player names and randomize teams of two based on the list of players and number of entries.
Then, the app will organize a bracket system for each round of the tournament. Special considerations:
Best of 3, both a winners and losers bracket because the tournament will be Double elimination. Additional features;
Calculate payouts based on entry fee, and able to keep track of High Scores on the side. 


<b>BACKUP IDEAS / future projects</b>

2) Web App that keeps score of 501 Darts game. 

App has GUI with buttons similiar to a calculator. Displays scores, averages, 
and suggested finishes for 2 players. Has a computer AI opponent that can be 
adjusted based on skill level of player. Possibly saves player profiles/stats 
server side, or exports to local device.

Program similar to my idea: n01
however, this is application is not web based.


3) Pacman remake (framework aided)

Possible use of Greenfoot framework. Would like to use custom made graphics, but may take too much time 
depending on hangups on the game's code. Will only make one level. Additional features: keep score, power-ups, 
advanced opponent AI.
